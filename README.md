# Task-4
In this task, I built a binary classification model using Logistic Regression on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The code follows a linear, step-by-step structure for clarity and ease of understanding. I started by loading and exploring the dataset, then standardized the features using StandardScaler to ensure consistency across input variables. I split the dataset into training and testing sets and trained the logistic regression model using scikit-learn. The model was evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score. I visualized performance using a confusion matrix and a ROC curve, which provided insights into the modelâ€™s classification behavior. This hands-on implementation helped reinforce core concepts of logistic regression and classification evaluation.
